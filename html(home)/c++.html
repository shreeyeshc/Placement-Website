<h2>C++ Programming Language</h2>
<div class="red">
  <pre><strong>Basic Concepts of Object Oriented Programming using C++</strong> 
    Object oriented programming – As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object oriented programming aims to implement real world entities like 
    inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operates on them so that 
    no other part of code can access this data except that function.
    Let us learn about different characteristics of an Object Oriented Programming language:
    Object: Objects are basic run-time entities in an object oriented system, objects are instances of a class these are defined user defined data types.
    ex:
    
    class person
    {
        char name[20];
        int id;
    public:
        void getdetails(){}
    };
     
    int main()
    {
       person p1; //p1 is a object 
    }
    Run on IDE
    Object take up space in memory and have an associated address like a record in pascal or structure or union in C.
    
    When a program is executed the objects interact by sending messages to one another.
    
    Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without having to know details of each others data or code, it is 
    sufficient to know the type of message accepted and type of response returned by the objects.
    
    
    
    Class: Class is a blueprint of data and functions or methods. Class does not take any space.
    
    
    
     
    
    Syntax for class:
    
    class class_name
    {
      private:
         //data members and member functions declarations
      public:
         //data members and member functions declarations
      protected:
         //data members and member functions declarations
    };
    Run on IDE
    Class is a user defined data type like structures and unions in C.
    
    By default class variables are private but in case of structure it is public. in above example person is a class.
    
    
    
    Encapsulation and Data abstraction: Wrapping up(combing) of data and functions into a single unit is known as encapsulation. The data is not 
    accessible to the outside world and only those functions which are wrapping in the class can access it. This insulation of the data from 
    direct access by the program is called data hiding or information hiding.
    
    Data abstraction refers to, providing only needed information to the outside world and hiding implementation details. For example, consider 
    a class Complex with public functions as getReal() and getImag(). We may implement the class as an array of size 2 or as two variables. 
    The advantage of abstractions is, we can change implementation at any point, users of Complex class wont’t be affected as out method interface 
    remains same. Had our implementation be public, we would not have been able to change it.
    
    
    
    Inheritance: inheritance is the process by which objects of one class acquire the properties of objects of another class. It supports the 
    concept of hierarchical classification. Inheritance provides re usability. This means that we can add additional features to an existing class 
    without modifying it.
    
    
    
    Polymorphism: polymorphism means ability to take more than one form. An operation may exhibit different behaviors in different instances. 
    The behavior depends upon the types of data used in the operation.
    C++ supports operator overloading and function overloading.
    Operator overloading is the process of making an operator to exhibit different behaviors in different instances is known as operator overloading.
    Function overloading is using a single function name to perform different types of tasks.
    Polymorphism is extensively used in implementing inheritance.
    
    
    
    Dynamic Binding: In dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to function call is decided at runtime. C++ has virtual functions to support this.
    
    
    
    Message Passing: Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information to each other. A message for an object is a request 
    for execution of a procedure and therefore will invoke a function in the receiving object that generates the desired results. Message passing involves 
    specifying the name of the object, the name of the function and the information to be sent.</pre>

  <pre><strong>C++ string class and its applications</strong> 
    In C++ we can store string by one of the two ways –

    C style strings
    string class (discussed in this post)
    In this post, second method is discussed. string class is part of C++ library that supports a lot much functionality over C style strings.
    C++ string class internally uses char array to store character but all memory management, allocation and null termination is handled by string class itself 
    that is why it is easy to use. The length of c++ string can be changed at runtime because of dynamic allocation of memory similar to vectors. As string class 
    is a container class, we can iterate over all its characters using an iterator similar to other containers like vector, set and maps, but generally we use a 
    simple for loop for iterating over the characters and index them using [] operator.
    C++ string class has a lot of functions to handle string easily. Most useful of them are demonstrated in below code.</pre>
</div>

<div class="blue">
  <pre><strong>Functions in C/C++</strong> 
    A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output.

    The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function, so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different 
    inputs, we can call the function.
    
     
    Example: 
    Below is a simple C program to demonstrate functions in C.
    
    #include <stdio.h>
     
    // An example function that takes two parameters 'x' and 'y'
    // as input and returns max of two input numbers
    int max(int x, int y)
    {
        if (x > y)
          return x;
        else
          return y;
    }
     
    // main function that doesn't receive any parameter and
    // returns integer.
    int main(void)
    {
        int a = 10, b = 20;
     
        // Calling above function to find max of 'a' and 'b'
        int m = max(a, b);
     
        printf("m is %d", m);
        return 0;
    }
    Run on IDE
    Output:
    
    m is 20</pre>
</div>

<div class="yellow">
  <pre><strong>Loops in C++</strong> 
    Loops in programming comes into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements. For example: Suppose we want to print “Hello World” 10 times. 
    This can be done in two ways as shown below:

    Iterative Method
    
    Iterative method to do this is to write the printf() statement 10 times.
    
    // C++ program to illustrate need of loops
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
     
    int main()
    {
        cout << "Hello World\n";
        cout << "Hello World\n";
        cout << "Hello World\n";
        cout << "Hello World\n";
        cout << "Hello World\n";
        cout << "Hello World\n";
        cout << "Hello World\n";
        cout << "Hello World\n";
        cout << "Hello World\n";
        cout << "Hello World\n";
        return 0;
    }
    Run on IDE
    Using Loops
    
    In Loop, the statement needs to be written only once and the loop will be executed 10 times as shown below.
    In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is reached.
    
    
    
     
    
    An operation is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed 
    number.
    Counter not Reached: If the counter has not reached the desired number, the next instruction in the sequence returns to the first instruction in the sequence 
    and repeat it.
    Counter reached: If the condition has been reached, the next instruction “falls through” to the next sequential instruction or branches outside the loop.
    There are mainly two types of loops:
    
    Entry Controlled loops: In this type of loops the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For Loop and While Loop are entry controlled loops.
    Exit Controlled Loops: In this type of loops the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of loop body. Therefore, the loop body will execute atleast 
    once, irrespective of whether the test condition is true or false. do – while loop is exit controlled loop.
    for Loop
    
    A for loop is a repetition control structure which allows us to write a loop that is executed a specific number of times. The loop enables us to perform n 
    number of steps together in one line.
    Syntax:
    
    for (initialization expr; test expr; update expr)
    {    
         // body of the loop
         // statements we want to execute
    }
    In for loop, a loop variable is used to control the loop. First initialize this loop variable to some value, then check whether this variable is less than 
    or greater than counter value. If  statement is true, then loop body is executed and loop variable gets updated . Steps are repeated till  exit condition comes.
    
    Initialization Expression: In this expression we have to initialize the loop counter to some value. for example: int i=1;
    Test Expression: In this expression we have to test the condition. If the condition evaluates to true then we will execute the body of loop and go to update 
    expression otherwise we will exit from the for loop. For example: i <= 10;
    Update Expression: After executing loop body this expression increments/decrements the loop variable by some value. for example: i++;
    // C++ program to illustrate for loop
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
     
    int main()
    {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
        {
            cout << "Hello World\n";
        }
     
        return 0;
    }
    While Loop

    While studying for loop we have seen that the number of iterations is known beforehand, i.e. the number of times the loop body is needed to be executed is known 
    to us.  while loops are used in situations where we do not know the exact number of iterations of loop beforehand. The loop execution is terminated on the basis 
    of test condition.
    
    Syntax:
    We have already stated that a loop is mainly consisted of three statements – initialization expression, test expression, update expression. The syntax of the t
    hree loops – For, while and do while mainly differs on the placement of these three statements.
    
    initialization expression;
    while (test_expression)
    {
       // statements
     
      update_expression;
    }
    // C++ program to illustrate for loop
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
     
    int main()
    {
        // initialization expression
        int i = 1;
     
        // test expression
        while (i < 6)
        {
            cout << "Hello World\n";
     
            // update expression
            i++;
        }
     
        return 0;
    }
    Run on IDE
    Output:
    
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    Hello World
    do while loop
    
    In do while loops also the loop execution is terminated on the basis of test condition. The main difference between do while loop and while loop is in do while 
    loop the condition is tested at the end of loop body, i.e do while loop is exit controlled whereas the other two loops are entry controlled loops.
    Note: In do while loop the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of test condition.
    
    Syntax:
    
    initialization expression;
    do
    {
       // statements
    
       update_expression;
    } while (test_expression);
    Note: Notice the semi – colon(“;”) in the end of loop.
    
    // C++ program to illustrate do-while loop
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
     
    int main()
    {
        int i = 2; // Initialization expression
     
        do
        {
            // loop body
            cout << "Hello World\n";
     
            // update expression
            i++;
     
        }  while (i < 1);   // test expression
     
        return 0;
    }
    Run on IDE
    Output:
    
    Hello World
    In the above program the test condition (i<1) evaluates to false. But still as the loop is exit – controlled the loop body will execute once.

    <pre><strong>Operators in C / C++</strong> 
        Operators are the foundation of any programming language. Thus the functionality of C/C++ programming language is incomplete without the use of operators. 
        We can define operators as symbols that helps us to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. In other words we can say that an 
        operator operates the operands.
        For example, consider the below statement:
        
        c = a + b;
        Here, ‘+’ is the operator known as addition operator and ‘a’ and ‘b’ are operands. The addition operator tells the compiler to add both of the operands ‘a’ 
        and ‘b’. C/C++ has many built-in operator types and they can be classified as:
        
        Arithmetic Operators: These are the operators used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. Examples: (+, -, *, /, %,++,–).
        Arithmetic operator are of two types:
        Unary Operators: Operators that operates or works with a single operand are unary operators.
        For example: (++ , –)
        Binary Operators: Operators that operates or works with two operands are binary operators.For example: (+ , – , * , /)
        To learn Arithmetic Operators in details visit this link.
        
        Relational Operators: Relational operators are used for comparison of the values of two operands. For example: checking if one operand is equal to the other 
        operand or not, an operand is greater than the other operand or not etc. Some of the relational operators are (==, > , = , <= ). To learn about each of these 
        operators in details go to this link.
        Logical Operators:  Logical Operators are used to combine two or more conditions/constraints or to complement the evaluation of the original condition in 
        consideration. The result of the operation of a logical operator is a boolean value either true or false. To learn about different logical operators in 
        details please visit this link.
        Bitwise Operators: The Bitwise operators is used to perform bit-level operations on the operands. The operators are first converted to bit-level and then c
        alculation is performed on the operands. The mathematical operations such as addition , subtraction , multiplication etc. can be performed at bit-level for faster 
        processing. To learn bitwise operators in details, visit this link.
        Assignment Operators: Assignment operators are used to assign value to a variable. The left side operand of the assignment operator is a variable and right side 
        operand of the assignment operator is a value. The value on the right side must be of the same data-type of variable on the left side otherwise the compiler will 
        raise an error.
        Different types of assignment operators are shown below:
        “=”: This is the simplest assignment operator. This operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left.
        For example:
        
        
         
        
        a = 10;
        b = 20;
        ch = 'y';
        “+=”:This operator is combination of ‘+’ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first adds the current value of the variable on left to the value on right and then 
        assigns the result to the variable on the left.
        Example:
        (a += b) can be written as (a = a + b)
        If initially value stored in a is 5. Then (a += 6) = 11.
        
        “-=”:This operator is combination of ‘-‘ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first subtracts the current value of the variable on left from the value on right 
        and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.
        Example:
        (a -= b) can be written as (a = a - b)
        If initially value stored in a is 8. Then (a -= 6) = 2.
        
        “*=”:This operator is combination of ‘*’ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first multiplies the current value of the variable on left to the value on right 
        and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.
        Example:
        (a *= b) can be written as (a = a * b)
        If initially value stored in a is 5. Then (a *= 6) = 30.
        
        “/=”:This operator is combination of ‘/’ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first divides the current value of the variable on left by the value on right 
        and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.
        Example:
        (a /= b) can be written as (a = a / b)
        If initially value stored in a is 6. Then (a /= 2) = 3.
        
        Other Operators: Apart from the above operators there are some other operators available in C or C++ used to perform some specific task. Some of them are 
        discussed here:
        sizeof operator: sizeof is a much used in the C/C++ programming language. It is a compile time unary operator which can be used to compute the size of 
        its operand. The result of sizeof is of unsigned integral type which is usually denoted by size_t. Basically, sizeof operator is used to compute the size 
        of the variable. To learn about sizeof operator in details you may visit this link.
        Comma Operator: The comma operator (represented by the token ,) is a binary operator that evaluates its first operand and discards the result, it then 
        evaluates the second operand and returns this value (and type). The comma operator has the lowest precedence of any C operator. Comma acts as both operator 
        and separator. To learn about comma in details visit this link.
        Conditional Operator: Conditional operator is of the form Expression1 ? Expression2 : Expression3 . Here, Expression1 is the condition to be evaluated. 
        If the condition(Expression1) is True then we will execute and return the result of Expression2 otherwise if the condition(Expression1) is false then we 
        will execute and return the result of Expression3. We may replace the use of if..else statements by conditional operators. To learn about conditional 
        operators in details, visit this link.
