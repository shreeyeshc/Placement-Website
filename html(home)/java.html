  <pre><strong>Classes and Objects in Java</strong> 
Classes and Objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming which revolve around the real life entities.

Class

A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:

    Modifiers : A class can be public or has default access (Refer this for details).
    Class name: The name should begin with a initial letter (capitalized by convention).
    Superclass(if any): The name of the class’s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
    Interfaces(if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
    Body: The class body surrounded by braces, { }.

Constructors are used for initializing new objects. Fields are variables that provides the state of the class and its objects, and methods are used to implement the behavior of the class and its objects.

There are various types of classes that are used in real time applications such as nested classes, anonymous classes, lambda expressions.


Object

It is a basic unit of Object Oriented Programming and represents the real life entities.  A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of :

    State : It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
    Behavior : It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
    Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

Example of an object : dog</pre>

  <pre><strong>Multithreading in Java</strong>
Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.

Threads can be created by using two mechanisms :
1. Extending the Thread class
2. Implementing the Runnable Interface</pre>

<div class="blue">
  <pre><strong>Variables in Java</strong> 
A variable is the name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.

    The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
    A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.
    In Java, all the variables must be declared before they can be used.

Types of variables
There are three types of variables in Java:


    Local Variables
    Instance Variables
    Static Variables
</pre>

<div class="yellow">
  <pre><strong>Java Identifiers</strong> 
In programming languages, identifiers are used for identification purpose. In Java an identifier can be a class name, method name, variable name or a label. For example :

public class Test
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int a = 20;
	}
}

In the above java code, we have 5 identifiers namely :

    Test : class name.
    main : method name.
    String : predefined class name.
    args : variable name.
    a :  variable name.

Rules for defining Java Identifiers

There are certain rules for defining a valid java identifiers. These rules must be followed, otherwise we get compile-time error. These rules are also valid for other languages like C,C++.

    The only allowed characters for identifiers are all alphanumeric characters([A-Z],[a-z],[0-9]), 
‘$‘(dollar sign) and ‘_‘ (underscore).For example “geek@” is not a valid java identifier as it contain ‘@’ – special character.
    Identifiers should not start with digits([0-9]). For example “123geeks” is a not a valid java identifier.
    Java identifiers are case-sensitive.
    There is no limit on the length of the identifier but it is advisable to use an optimum length of 4 – 15 letters only.
    Reserved Words can’t be used as an identifier. For example “int while = 20;” is an invalid statement as while is a reserved word. There are 53 reserved words in Java.

  <pre><strong>Difference between Abstract Class and Interface in Java</strong> 
Abstraction: Hiding the internal implementation of the feature and only showing the functionality to the users. i.e. what it works (showing), how it works (hiding). Both abstract class and interface are used for abstraction.

Abstract class vs Interface

    Type of methods: Interface can have only abstract methods. Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
    Final Variables: Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.
    Type of variables: Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. Interface has only static and final variables.
    Implementation: Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface. Interface can’t provide the implementation of abstract class.
    Inheritance vs Abstraction: A Java interface can be implemented using keyword “implements” and abstract class can be extended using keyword “extends”.
    Multiple implementation: An interface can extend another Java interface only, an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
    Accessibility of Data Members: Members of a Java interface are public by default. A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.

</pre>
</div>

<div class="green">
  <pre><strong>Interfaces in Java</strong> 
Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables, but the methods declared in interface are by default abstract (only method signature, no body).  

    Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the class.
    An Interface is about capabilities like a Player may be an interface and any class implementing Player must be able to (or must implement) move(). So it specifies a set of methods that the class has to implement.
    If a class implements an interface and does not provide method bodies for all functions specified in the interface, then class must be declared abstract.
    A Java library example is, Comparator Interface. If a class implements this interface, then it can be used to sort a collection.
