  <pre><strong>Find the minimum time</strong> 
    Davis who has number of scanners in his shop select only two scanners to scan the documents of a customer. When a customer comes to his shop he knows three parameters S1, S2 and N.  S1 and S2 are the time taken by scanner 1 and scanner 2 to scan one document respectively And N is the number of documents given by the customer. As he is suppose to entertain a number of customers, he wants to calculate the minimum time to scan all the N documents using those two scanners.

    Input:
    The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains three space separated integers S1, S2 and N.
    
    Output:
    In new line, print the minimum time required.
    
    Constraints:
    1<=T<=500
    1<=S1,S2,N<=106

    <pre><strong>Leaf under budget (Function Problem)</strong> 
        Given a binary tree and a budget. Assume you are at the root of the tree, you need to maximise the count of leaf nodes you can visit in your budget if you have to pay particular cost every time you visit a new node in the Tree ( you have to pay cost to visit leaf node also). Your task is to complete the function getCount().

        Input:
        The function takes two arguments as input, the reference pointer to the root of the binary tree and a variable budget denoting the budget provided to you.
        There will be T test cases and for each test case the function will be called separately.
        
        Output:
        For each test case output the total of number of the leaf nodes you can visit in the provided budget.
        
        Constraints:
        1<=T<=100
        1<=N<=100

        TestCase 1:
        Binary Tree is as:

    <pre><strong>AVL Tree Deletion (Function Problem)</strong> 
        Given a root of the tree you need to perform AVL tree deletion operations on it. You need to complete the method delelteNode which takes 2 arguments the first is the root of the tree and the second is the value of the node to be deleted.The function should return the root of the modified tree.

        Note: Your code will be checked for each insertion and will produce an output 1 if all the nodes for a particular test case were correctly inserted else 0.
        
        Input:
        The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains 2 lines . The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the no of nodes to be inserted in the AVL tree and in the next line are N space separated values denoting the values of the nodes to be inserted to the tree. And last line denotes the element to be deleted.
        
        Output:
        For each test case output will be 1 if the node was correctly deleted else 0.
